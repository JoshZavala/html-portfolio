<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello I am Joshua Zavala and I was born in 1992 so that would make me 32 years old now. I have 2 cocker spaniels and a fiance who I will
  have my wedding with in Hawaii. Some of my hobbies include gaming, riding my motorcycle(yamaha r6) and watching shows.

<p>As a kid, you could not take me off electronics. I would be on gaming consoles,cell phones and computers. When new technology would come
  out I was the kid that had to have it. Around the age of 14 is when I was introduced to online gaming. Almost the same time I was
  completely hooked to PC gaming. By the age of 17 I built my first computer. Now dont get me wrong it was low-end because I was not
  fully knowledgable at the time. Currently I have built a total of 5 PCs.</p>

<p>I have worked in Manufacturing for over 10years
  as a Lab Tech and Machine operator for Pepsi and Ozarka. I decided to make a change to follow my passion, Information Technology, 
  I am excited to start my new journey in Web Development,growing and learning a new skillset.</p>
